# Biorhythm Nutrition Protocol
## Optimizing Body Composition Through Circadian Nutrition
### Based on BÃ¸rge Fagerli's Research & Methods

## Core Philosophy
- Align nutrient timing with circadian rhythms
- Higher fat intake early, carbohydrates later
- Metabolic flexibility optimization
- Leptin and adiponectin regulation
- Natural hunger/satiety signal restoration

## Scientific Foundation

### Key Hormonal Considerations
1. **Leptin** - Metabolic regulator, peaks 2-4 hours after sleep
2. **Adiponectin** - Links obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation
3. **Insulin Sensitivity** - Highest systemically in morning
4. **Cortisol** - Peaks morning, reduced by evening carbs
5. **Growth Hormone** - Peaks during deep sleep

### Metabolic Flexibility Principles
- Morning fat consumption = enhanced fat oxidation all day
- Evening carbs = improved leptin signaling overnight
- LPL enzyme activity higher in muscle vs fat cells early
- Muscle insulin sensitivity maintained longer post-training

## Daily Nutrient Distribution

### Morning & Afternoon (First 8 hours awake)
**Macronutrient Focus:** Higher Fat, Moderate Protein, Lower Carbs

**Per Meal Targets:**
- Fat: 20-50g
- Protein: 20-40g
- Carbohydrates: 0-40g (activity dependent)

**Food Choices:**
- Whole eggs (never discard yolks)
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel)
- Nuts and nut butters
- Avocado
- Olive oil, coconut oil
- Full-fat cheese
- Fatty cuts of meat

### Pre-Training (1-3 hours before)
**Purpose:** Fuel without metabolic disruption

**Intake:**
- Carbohydrates: 20-40g
- Minimal fat
- Light protein if desired

**Options:**
- Fruit (banana, dates)
- Rice cakes
- Training drink with glucose/fructose mix

### Post-Training (0-2 hours after)
**Purpose:** Recovery and anabolic signaling

**Macronutrient Ratios:**
- Carbohydrates: 2-4:1 with protein
- Protein: 30-40g
- Fat: 5-20g (acceptable, even beneficial)

**Example Meal:**
- 60-120g carbs
- 30g protein
- 10-20g fat

### Evening (Final 4-6 hours before bed)
**Macronutrient Focus:** Higher Carbs, Moderate Protein, Lower Fat

**Targets:**
- Carbohydrates: Scale to hunger/activity
- Protein: 40-60g (covers overnight fast)
- Fat: Minimal (5-10g max)

**Carb Sources:**
- White jasmine/basmati rice
- Potatoes, sweet potatoes
- Oatmeal
- Rice flour pancakes

## Training Day Adjustments

### Strength Training Days
**Pre-workout:** 30-40g carbs
**Post-workout:** 60-100g carbs
**Evening:** 80-120g carbs
**Total Daily:** 170-260g carbs

### Cardio/Conditioning Days
**Morning:** Fasted or minimal carbs
**Post-workout:** 40-60g carbs
**Evening:** 60-80g carbs
**Total Daily:** 100-140g carbs

### Rest Days
**Morning/Afternoon:** <20g carbs per meal
**Evening:** 60-100g carbs
**Total Daily:** 80-140g carbs

## Body Composition Goals

### Fat Loss Phase
**Caloric Deficit:** 300-500 kcal below maintenance

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce morning fats to 15-25g
- Keep protein at 2.0-2.5g/kg BW
- Maintain evening carbs for leptin
- Add 16:8 intermittent fasting

### Muscle Gain Phase
**Caloric Surplus:** 300-500 kcal above maintenance

**Adjustments:**
- Increase post-workout carbs
- Add extra meal if needed
- Fat intake up to 30-50g morning meals
- Protein 1.8-2.2g/kg BW

### Maintenance/Recomposition
**Calories:** At maintenance

**Focus:**
- Strict nutrient timing adherence
- Training day vs rest day cycling
- Listen to hunger signals

## Practical Meal Templates

### Morning Meal Examples

**Option 1: Eggs & Avocado**
- 3-4 whole eggs
- 1/2 avocado
- Mixed vegetables
- 1 slice ezekiel bread

**Option 2: Protein & Nuts**
- 30g protein powder in water
- 30g almonds or walnuts
- 1 apple

### Post-Training Meal Examples

**Option 1: Rice & Chicken**
- 150g white rice (cooked)
- 150g chicken breast
- Large salad with olive oil

**Option 2: Protein Pancakes**
- Rice flour pancakes
- 30g whey protein
- Banana and honey

### Evening Meal Examples

**Option 1: Potato & Lean Protein**
- 300g potatoes
- 150g white fish or turkey
- Steamed vegetables

**Option 2: Protein Rice Pudding**
- 150g jasmine rice
- 40g casein protein
- Cinnamon and stevia

## Supplementation Strategy

### Morning
- Omega-3: 2-3g EPA/DHA
- Vitamin D3: 2000-5000 IU
- Magnesium: 200-400mg

### Pre-Training
- Caffeine: 100-200mg (optional)
- L-Citrulline: 6-8g
- Beta-alanine: 3-5g

### Post-Training
- Creatine: 5g
- Whey/Casein blend: 30-40g

### Evening
- Magnesium Glycinate: 200-400mg
- Zinc: 10-15mg
- Casein protein: 20-30g

## Special Considerations

### Women's Adjustments
**Follicular Phase (Day 1-14):**
- Higher carb tolerance
- Can increase training carbs

**Luteal Phase (Day 15-28):**
- Higher fat needs
- Increase morning fats
- Watch sodium/water retention

### Shift Workers
- Maintain fat/carb separation
- "Morning" = first meal after waking
- "Evening" = last 2 meals before sleep
- Keep consistent meal timing

### Endurance Athletes
- Increase total carbohydrate intake
- Add intra-workout carbs for 90+ min sessions
- Maintain nutrient timing principles

## Hunger & Satiety Management

### If Hungry Between Meals:
**Morning/Afternoon:** Fat/protein snack
- Nuts, cheese, protein shake with coconut milk

**Evening:** Carb/protein snack
- Fruit, rice cakes with jam, protein pudding

### Appetite Regulation Tips
- Allow 2-3 weeks adaptation period
- Drink water before declaring hunger
- Check if craving is specific (indicates need)
- Trust body signals after adaptation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Mixing high fat + high carb in same meal
- Eating carbs immediately upon waking
- Avoiding all carbs in evening
- Not adjusting for training volume
- Ignoring hunger/satiety signals
- Insufficient protein distribution

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Metrics
- Body weight (same time/conditions)
- Waist measurement
- Energy levels (1-10 scale)
- Sleep quality (1-10 scale)
- Training performance

### Adjustment Protocols
- No change after 2 weeks: Reduce calories 10%
- Energy crashes: Increase workout carbs
- Poor sleep: Increase evening carbs
- Excessive hunger: Increase morning fats

## Integration with Training Protocols
- Starting Strength: Higher carbs on training days
- Convict Conditioning: Moderate carbs, higher fat
- Myo-reps: Emphasis on post-workout carbs
- Norwegian Method: Higher total carb intake
- NBA Power: Periodize nutrition with training phases
