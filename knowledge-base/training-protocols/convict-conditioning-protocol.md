# Convict Conditioning Protocol
## Author: Paul Wade

### Core Philosophy
- Progressive calisthenics is superior to weights for functional strength
- Master your own bodyweight before external resistance
- Joint health and mobility are paramount
- Quality over quantity - perfect form always
- 'Armor-plated' joints through gradual progression

### Programming Guidelines

#### Progression Standards
Each exercise has three standards:
- **Beginner Standard**: Move to next step
- **Intermediate Standard**: Good strength base
- **Progression Standard**: Required before advancing

Example (Full Push-ups):
- Beginner: 1 x 5
- Intermediate: 2 x 10
- Progression: 2 x 20

#### Training Schedules

**New Blood (Beginners)**
- 2-3 days per week
- 1-2 exercises per session
- Focus on form and slow progression

**Good Behavior (Intermediate)**
- 3-4 days per week
- 2-3 exercises per session
- Can combine pushing/pulling

**Veterano (Advanced)**
- 4-6 days per week
- Multiple exercises per session
- Can work different progressions simultaneously

### Weekly Routines

#### Minimalist Routine (2x/week)
**Monday:**
- Push-up Progression
- Leg Raise Progression

**Thursday:**
- Squat Progression
- Pull-up Progression

#### Standard Routine (3x/week)
**Monday:**
- Push-ups
- Pull-ups

**Wednesday:**
- Squats
- Bridges

**Friday:**
- Handstand Push-ups
- Leg Raises

#### Full Routine (6x/week)
**Monday:**
- Push-ups
- Leg Raises

**Tuesday:**
- Pull-ups
- Squats

**Wednesday:**
- Handstand Push-ups
- Bridges

**Thursday:**
- Push-ups
- Leg Raises

**Friday:**
- Pull-ups
- Squats

**Saturday:**
- Handstand Push-ups
- Bridges

**Sunday:** Rest

### Equipment Adaptations

#### No Equipment Available
- Wall work for handstands
- Doorway pulls for early pull-ups
- Floor work for all other exercises

#### Limited Equipment (Recommended)
- Pull-up bar (doorway mounted acceptable)
- Basketball or soccer ball for bridges
- Books/blocks for elevation

#### Optimal Setup
- Pull-up bar
- Parallel bars/dip station
- Wall space
- Exercise mat

### Client Adaptations

#### For Hypertrophy Goals
- Higher volume (3-4 sets per exercise)
- Slower tempo (2-1-2)
- Reduce rest periods (60-90 seconds)
- Add supplementary exercises

#### For Strength Focus
- Lower reps at harder progressions
- Longer rest periods (2-3 minutes)
- Focus on tension techniques
- Practice skill work separately

#### For Weight Loss
- Circuit format
- Minimal rest between exercises
- Higher frequency (4-5x/week)
- Combine with dietary protocol

#### For Rehabilitation
- Start at Step 1 regardless of fitness
- Extra slow progression
- Focus on joint mobility
- Add specific rehab exercises

### Special Populations

#### Beginners Over 40
- Start with 6-week conditioning phase
- Double the time at each progression
- Add joint mobility work daily
- Consider starting at 2x8 instead of 2x10

#### Former Athletes
- May progress faster initially
- Watch for ego-driven advancement
- Focus on perfect form to prevent injury
- Consider hybrid approach with weights

#### Endurance Athletes
- Lower volume per session
- Higher frequency
- Focus on explosive variations
- Integrate with sport training

#### Obese Individuals
- Start with wall variations for all movements
- Progress based on form, not reps
- May need longer at each level
- Consider dietary intervention concurrently

### Advanced Techniques

#### Consolidation Training
- Spend 4-8 weeks at each level
- Build work capacity
- Prevent overuse injuries
- Master the movement

#### Hybrid Sets
- Combine two progression levels
- Example: 5 close push-ups + 10 regular
- Builds strength and endurance

#### Tension Techniques
- Maximum tension throughout movement
- Slow, controlled tempo
- Isometric holds at difficulty points
- Builds extraordinary strength

#### Volume Cycling
- Heavy week: Harder progressions, lower reps
- Medium week: Current level, moderate reps
- Light week: Easier progression, higher reps

### Rest and Recovery

#### Between Sets
- 30-60 seconds for easier progressions
- 60-120 seconds for intermediate
- 2-5 minutes for advanced progressions

#### Between Workouts
- Minimum 48 hours for same muscle group
- Can train daily if alternating patterns
- Listen to joint feedback

### Common Errors
- Progressing too quickly
- Ignoring joint discomfort
- Skipping 'easy' progressions
- Poor form to achieve reps
- Not respecting the bridge progression
- Adding weight before mastering bodyweight
- Training through pain

### Integration with Other Training

#### With Cardio
- Can combine with cardio on off days
- HIIT on separate days
- Light cardio (walking) daily is fine

#### With Weight Training
- Weights for legs if pistols impossible
- Can use weights for assistance exercises
- Keep weights as secondary focus

#### With Skill Work
- Handstands separate from strength
- Flexibility training on all days
- Mobility work as warm-up

### Troubleshooting

#### Stuck at a Level
- Add consolidation period (4-8 weeks)
- Check form with video
- Ensure adequate nutrition and sleep
- Consider slight regression then rebuild

#### Joint Pain
- Regress 1-2 levels immediately
- Add joint mobility work
- Check form carefully
- May need medical evaluation

#### Imbalanced Development
- Some progressions will lag
- Don't force even development
- Address weaknesses with extra volume
- Consider easier variations for more reps

### Long-Term Development
- Expect 2-5 years to master all six
- One-arm variations require exceptional patience
- Maintenance possible with 2-3x/week
- Continue to challenge with tempo, holds, and variations
