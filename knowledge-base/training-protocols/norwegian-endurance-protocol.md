# Norwegian Method & Advanced Endurance Protocols
## Lactate-Guided Training System

### Core Philosophy
- Control intensity through lactate measurement
- High volume at low intensity (80%+)
- Threshold work is key (not VO2max)
- Double threshold days for elite adaptation
- Long-term development over short gains

### Three-Zone Model

#### Zone 1: Low Intensity
- Below LT1 (first lactate threshold)
- Lactate: <2 mmol/L
- 75-85% of weekly volume
- Conversational pace
- Fat oxidation primary fuel

#### Zone 2: Threshold
- Between LT1 and LT2
- Lactate: 2-4 mmol/L (target: 3 mmol/L)
- 15-20% of weekly volume
- Controlled discomfort
- Maximal mitochondrial stimulation

#### Zone 3: High Intensity
- Above LT2 (anaerobic threshold)
- Lactate: >4 mmol/L
- 5-10% of weekly volume
- Race pace or faster
- Neuromuscular power

### Norwegian Threshold Intervals

#### Standard Protocol
**Morning Session:**
- 5 x 2000m at threshold pace
- 60-90 seconds rest
- Lactate checks every 2 intervals
- Target: 2.5-3.5 mmol/L

**Evening Session (same day):**
- 10 x 1000m at threshold pace
- 30-60 seconds rest
- Slightly faster than morning
- Target: 3-4 mmol/L

#### Progression Model
**Phase 1: Build Volume**
- Single threshold sessions
- 3-4x per week
- 20-30 minutes total threshold time

**Phase 2: Double Days**
- 2x double threshold per week
- 40-60 minutes total threshold daily
- Maintain high Z1 volume

**Phase 3: Competition**
- Reduce to 1x double per week
- Add race-pace work
- Taper volume by 30%

### Weekly Structure (Elite)

**Monday:**
- AM: 90 min easy (Zone 1)
- PM: Threshold intervals 5x6 min

**Tuesday:**
- AM: 60 min easy
- PM: 90 min easy

**Wednesday:**
- AM: Threshold 6x1000m
- PM: Threshold 3x2000m

**Thursday:**
- 120 min easy

**Friday:**

- PM: Threshold 10x400m

**Saturday:**
- Zone 3 workout or race
- Example: 10x200m hills

**Sunday:**

**Weekly Total: ~110-120 miles**

### Adaptation for Non-Elite

#### Intermediate (30-50 miles/week)
**Structure:**
- 2x threshold sessions
- No doubles initially

- Wed: Easy 60 min
- Thu: Easy 45 min
- Fri: Threshold 6x800m
- Sat: Easy 30 min
- Sun: Long 90 min

#### Beginner (<30 miles/week)
- 1x threshold weekly
- Focus on Zone 1 volume

**Example Week:**
- Mon: Easy 30 min
- Tue: Rest or cross-train
- Wed: Threshold 3x800m
- Thu: Easy 30 min
- Fri: Rest
- Sat: Easy 40 min
- Sun: Long 60 min

### Lactate Testing Protocol

#### Field Testing
1. Warm up 15 minutes easy
2. Run 1200m at perceived threshold
3. Test lactate immediately
4. Rest 3 minutes
5. Adjust pace up/down based on reading
6. Repeat until finding 3 mmol/L pace

#### Without Lactate Meter
- Use heart rate: 85-90% max
- Breathing: Can speak 3-4 words
- RPE: 6-7 out of 10
- 'Comfortably hard'
- Talk test: Sentences difficult, phrases okay

#### Lactate Meter Recommendations
- Sport-specific models (Lactate Pro, Lactate Plus)
- Test strips shelf life consideration
- Finger prick technique
- Record keeping critical

### Nutrition Considerations

#### Zone 1 Training
- Fasted optional for fat adaptation
- Low carb acceptable
- Hydration critical
- Electrolytes if >90 minutes

#### Zone 2 (Threshold)
- Carb availability essential
- 30-60g carbs/hour if >60 min
- Quick-digesting pre-workout
- Recovery nutrition within 30 min

#### Zone 3 Work
- High carb pre-workout
- Glycogen priority
- Creatine supplementation beneficial
- Fast recovery essential

### Supplementation

#### Evidence-Based
- Caffeine (3-6mg/kg pre-threshold)
- Beta-alanine (3-6g daily for Zone 3)
- Sodium bicarbonate (for lactate buffering)
- Beetroot juice (nitrates for efficiency)

#### Recovery Support
- Protein (1.6-2.2g/kg daily)
- Omega-3 (anti-inflammatory)
- Vitamin D (if deficient)
- Magnesium (for sleep/recovery)

### Common Errors
- Too much Zone 3 (intensity addiction)
- Zone 1 too fast (>2 mmol/L)
- Inadequate recovery
- Skipping lactate monitoring
- Progressing too quickly
- Medium intensity 'junk miles'
- Neglecting strength training
- Poor sleep hygiene

### Cross-Training Options

#### For Injury Prevention
- Swimming (1x/week)
- Cycling (Zone 1)
- Elliptical (recovery days)
- Deep water running

#### For Strength Maintenance
- Bodyweight circuits
- Kettlebell work
- Hill walking with weight vest
- Plyometrics (in-season minimal)

### Testing Protocols

#### Monthly Time Trial
- 3-5K for 5K/10K runners
- 10K for marathoners
- Standardized course
- Track lactate at finish
- Assess progress

#### Lactate Step Test
- 5-6 stages, 5 minutes each
- Increase pace each stage
- Test at end of each
- Plot lactate curve
- Assess threshold shifts

### Special Considerations

#### Masters Athletes (40+)
- Longer recovery needed
- Reduce double threshold frequency
- Emphasize Zone 1 volume
- Monitor overtraining carefully

#### Female Athletes
- Consider menstrual cycle effects
- Luteal phase: easier training
- Follicular phase: harder sessions
- Iron status monitoring

#### Heat/Altitude Training
- Zone 1 pace slower initially
- Threshold watts/power, not pace
- Extra hydration critical
- Acclimatization period needed
