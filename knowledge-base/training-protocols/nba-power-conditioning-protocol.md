# NBA Power Conditioning Protocol
## Athletic Development for Multi-Sport Performance
### Based on National Basketball Conditioning Coaches Association Methods

## Core Philosophy
- Sport-specific power development while maintaining general athleticism
- Periodization is king - 85% of NBA coaches use periodized models
- Multi-directional movement capacity
- Injury prevention through balanced development
- Year-round training with strategic intensity variation

## Testing & Assessment Parameters
Average of 7.3 fitness parameters tested:
1. **Body Composition** - Most common assessment
2. **Vertical Jump** - Power output measure
3. **Lane Agility Test** - Multi-directional speed
4. **Three-Quarter Court Sprint** - Basketball-specific speed
5. **Flexibility/Mobility** - Injury prevention
6. **Strength Baselines** - Squat, bench, pull-up standards
7. **Core Stability** - Foundation for all movement

## Training Phases (Periodization Model)

### Phase 1: Anatomical Adaptation (3 weeks)
- General preparation
- Movement quality focus
- Injury prevention emphasis
- Volume: High, Intensity: Low

### Phase 2: Hypertrophy (4 weeks)
- Muscle mass development
- Work capacity building
- Sets: 3-4, Reps: 8-12
- Rest: 60-90 seconds

### Phase 3: Strength (4 weeks)
- Maximum strength development
- Sets: 3-5, Reps: 3-6
- Rest: 2-4 minutes
- 85-95% 1RM

### Phase 4: Power (3-4 weeks)
- Explosive movement
- Olympic lifts (95% of coaches use them)
- Plyometrics (100% implementation)
- Sets: 3-4, Reps: 3-5
- Rest: 3-5 minutes

## Weekly Training Structure

### In-Season (Maintenance)
**Frequency:** 3-4 days/week
- Monday: Lower Power + Core
- Tuesday: Upper Strength
- Thursday: Total Body Circuit
- Saturday: Recovery/Mobility

### Off-Season (Development)
**Frequency:** 4-5 days/week
- Monday: Lower Power
- Tuesday: Upper Power
- Thursday: Lower Strength
- Friday: Upper Strength
- Saturday: Conditioning

## Exercise Selection Hierarchy

### Primary Movements (Most Used)
1. **Squat Variations** - Foundation of lower body
   - Back squat
   - Front squat
   - Box squat
   - Split squats

2. **Olympic Lifts & Variations**
   - Power clean
   - Hang clean
   - Clean pulls
   - Push press

3. **Plyometrics** (Progressive)
   - Box jumps
   - Depth jumps
   - Medicine ball throws
   - Lateral bounds

### Sport-Specific Training Components

#### Basketball-Specific
- Court sprints (baseline to free throw)
- Lane agility drills
- Defensive slides
- Jump-stop-jump sequences
- Rotational power work

#### Soccer/Football Adaptation
- Acceleration work (10-20m)
- Deceleration training
- Change of direction (5-10-5)
- Single-leg stability

#### Combat Sports Adaptation
- Rotational power emphasis
- Core endurance circuits
- Grip strength variations
- Explosive pushing/pulling

## Flexibility & Mobility Protocol

### Dynamic Warm-up (Pre-Training)
- Leg swings (3 planes)
- Walking lunges with rotation
- Inchworms
- High knees/butt kicks
- Arm circles
- 10-15 minutes total

### Static Stretching (Post-Training)
- Hold 30-60 seconds
- Focus on hip flexors, hamstrings, calves
- Shoulder complex
- Thoracic spine mobility

## Conditioning Methods

### Energy System Development

#### Anaerobic Power (Basketball/Soccer)
- Work: 10-30 seconds
- Rest: 1:3 to 1:5 ratio
- Examples: Court sprints, bike sprints

#### Anaerobic Capacity (Combat Sports)
- Work: 30-90 seconds
- Rest: 1:1 to 1:2 ratio
- Examples: Circuit training, bag work

#### Aerobic Base (All Sports)
- 20-40 minutes continuous
- 65-75% max heart rate
- 2-3x per week off-season

## Recovery & Regeneration

### Active Recovery Methods
- Pool sessions
- Yoga/stretching
- Light cycling
- Foam rolling

### Nutrition Timing
- Pre-workout: 30-40g carbs
- Post-workout: 2:1 carb:protein ratio
- Hydration: Body weight (lbs) x 0.5-1.0 = oz per day

## Program Adaptations

### Youth Athletes (Under 18)
- Focus on movement quality
- Bodyweight before external load
- Fun and varied exercises
- Shorter training sessions (45-60 min)

### Masters Athletes (35+)
- Extended warm-ups
- Lower training frequency
- Focus on mobility/flexibility
- Moderate intensities

### Female Athletes
- ACL prevention emphasis
- Single-leg strength priority
- Core stability focus
- Hormonal considerations

## Sample Workout: Power Development

**Warm-up:**
- Dynamic stretching 10 min
- Activation drills 5 min

**Main:**
1. Hang Clean: 4x3 @ 70-80%
2. Box Jump: 4x5
3. Front Squat: 4x4 @ 80%
4. DB Step-ups: 3x8 each
5. Medicine Ball Slams: 4x6

**Cool-down:**
- Static stretching 10 min
- Foam rolling 5 min

## Integration with Sport Practice

### Pre-Practice (30 min)
- Activation work
- Movement prep
- Injury prevention

### Post-Practice (20 min)
- Recovery protocols
- Corrective exercises
- Flexibility work

## Key Performance Indicators

### Strength Standards (Relative to BW)
- Squat: 1.5-2.0x BW
- Bench: 1.0-1.25x BW
- Pull-ups: 10-15 reps
- Vertical Jump: 24-30 inches

### Speed Standards
- 10m sprint: <1.8 seconds
- Three-quarter court: <3.2 seconds
- Lane agility: <11.5 seconds

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Neglecting flexibility work
- Too much sport-specific work in-season
- Inadequate recovery between sessions
- Poor exercise progression
- Ignoring asymmetries
