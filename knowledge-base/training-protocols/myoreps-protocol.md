# Myo-Reps Protocol
## Author: Børge Fagerli

### Scientific Foundation
- Based on effective reps theory (final reps near failure drive growth)
- Maximizes muscle fiber recruitment through fatigue
- Maintains constant tension and metabolic stress
- Time-efficient hypertrophy training
- Occlusion training principles without restricts blood flow

### Core Principles

#### Effective Reps Concept
- First reps in a set = warm-up for muscle fibers
- Last 5 reps before failure = maximum fiber recruitment
- Myo-reps maintains this peak recruitment state
- Every rep after activation becomes 'effective'

#### Motor Unit Recruitment (Henneman's Size Principle)
1. Light loads recruit Type I fibers first
2. As fatigue accumulates, Type II fibers activate
3. Near failure = full fiber recruitment
4. Short rest maintains Type II activation

### Myo-Reps Structure

#### The Activation Set
- 15-30 reps at RPE 8-9 (1-2 reps from failure)
- Creates metabolic fatigue
- Activates all fiber types
- Sets up for effective mini-sets

#### Mini-Sets (Myo-Rep Sets)
- 3-5 reps per mini-set
- 3-5 deep breaths between (5-15 seconds)
- Same weight as activation set
- 3-5 total mini-sets

### Loading Guidelines

#### By Experience Level
**Beginners:**
- 40-50% 1RM
- Activation: 15-20 reps
- Mini-sets: 3 x 3-5 reps
- 1 Myo-rep series per exercise

**Intermediate:**
- 30-40% 1RM
- Activation: 20-25 reps
- Mini-sets: 4-5 x 3-5 reps
- 1-2 Myo-rep series per exercise

**Advanced:**
- 30-35% 1RM
- Activation: 25-30 reps
- Mini-sets: 5-6 x 3-5 reps
- 2-3 Myo-rep series per exercise

### Exercise Selection

#### Best Exercises for Myo-Reps
**Machines/Cables:**
- Leg press
- Chest press
- Lat pulldown
- Cable rows
- Leg curls/extensions
- Cable laterals

**Free Weights (Isolation):**
- Dumbbell curls
- Lateral raises
- Rear delt flies
- Tricep extensions
- Calf raises

**Bodyweight:**
- Push-ups
- Pull-ups (band assisted)
- Dips
- Split squats

#### Exercises to Avoid
- Heavy compounds (squats, deadlifts)
- Olympic lifts
- Complex movements requiring stability
- Exercises with high injury risk at fatigue

### Programming Integration

#### As Primary Method (Hypertrophy Phase)
**Week Structure:**
- Monday: Push muscles (2-3 exercises with Myo-reps)
- Wednesday: Pull muscles (2-3 exercises with Myo-reps)
- Friday: Legs (2-3 exercises with Myo-reps)

#### As Finisher (Mixed Training)
- Complete main compound work first
- Add 1-2 Myo-rep exercises at end
- Target lagging muscle groups
- 2-3x per week maximum

#### In Deload Weeks
- Reduce to 1 activation set + 2 mini-sets
- Use 30% 1RM
- Maintains technique and blood flow
- Allows recovery

### Volume Guidelines

#### Weekly Volume by Muscle Group
- Small muscles: 4-8 Myo-rep series
- Large muscles: 6-12 Myo-rep series
- Frequency: 2-3x per week per muscle
- Count as 3-4 regular sets equivalent

### Progression Methods

1. **Add Mini-Sets**: 3 → 4 → 5
2. **Add Reps**: 3 reps → 4 → 5 per mini-set
3. **Decrease Rest**: 5 breaths → 4 → 3
4. **Increase Load**: When hitting 5x5 easily
5. **Add Series**: 1 → 2 Myo-rep series

### Client Adaptations

#### For Pure Hypertrophy
- 2-3 Myo-rep series per exercise
- 4-5 exercises per muscle group
- Higher activation reps (25-30)
- Shorter rest (3 breaths)

#### For Strength-Hypertrophy
- 1 Myo-rep series after main lifts
- Lower activation reps (15-20)
- Focus on compound movements
- Longer rest (5 breaths)

#### For Fat Loss
- Circuit format with Myo-reps
- No rest between exercises
- Full-body workouts
- 3-4x per week

#### For Time-Constrained
- Full-body Myo-reps workout
- 1 exercise per muscle group
- 20-minute sessions
- 3x per week

### Special Populations

#### Masters Athletes (40+)
- Lower activation reps (12-15)
- Stop 2-3 reps from failure
- Longer rest periods
- Focus on joint-friendly exercises

#### Rehabilitation
- Very light loads (20-30% 1RM)
- Higher activation reps
- Focus on blood flow
- Avoid failure

#### Women
- May handle higher volume better
- Can use shorter rest periods (3 breaths)
- Progress more conservatively with load
- Excellent for glute/leg development

#### Hardgainers/Ectomorphs
- Use as finisher only
- Keep volume conservative
- Focus on major muscle groups
- Prioritize compound movements first

### Fatigue Management

#### Stop Criteria
1. Cannot complete 3 reps in mini-set
2. Form breakdown
3. More than 50% rep speed reduction
4. 6 total mini-sets reached

#### Recovery Requirements
- 48-72 hours between same muscle
- Deload every 4th week
- Monitor performance decreases
- Adequate protein and sleep

### Tempo and Breathing

#### Tempo Guidelines
- Activation set: Controlled, 2-0-2
- Mini-sets: Slightly faster, 1-0-1
- No bouncing or momentum
- Full range of motion

#### Breathing Protocol
- Deep breath at top of each rep in mini-sets
- 3-5 breaths between mini-sets
- Don't hold breath during reps
- Exhale on concentric

### Tracking and Progression

#### What to Track
- Activation set reps
- Number of mini-sets completed
- Reps per mini-set
- Weight used
- Rest period (breaths)

#### Sample Notation
`Leg Press: 200 lbs - 25 + 5,5,5,4,3`
(25 activation reps, then 5 mini-sets)

### Common Mistakes
- Going to complete failure on activation
- Resting too long between mini-sets
- Using too heavy weights
- Poor exercise selection
- Excessive volume
- Not tracking performance
- Improper breathing

- Power blocks: Avoid or minimal use
- Deload weeks: Reduced volume version

#### With Other Techniques
- Can combine with pre-exhaust
- Works well after compound lifts
- Compatible with supersets
- Avoid combining with drop sets (too much fatigue)

### Troubleshooting

#### Not Getting Pump
- Increase activation reps
- Decrease rest between mini-sets
- Check exercise selection
- Ensure proper form/ROM

#### Too Fatigued/Systemic
- Reduce total volume
- Longer rest periods
- Better exercise selection
- Check recovery factors

#### Plateaued Progress
- Change progression variable
- Switch exercises
- Add/reduce volume
- Take deload week

### Long-Term Application
- Effective for 4-8 week blocks
- Rotate with other methods
- Excellent for specialization phases
- Can return to periodically
- Monitor for overtraining signs
