# Starting Strength Protocol
## Author: Mark Rippetoe & Andy Baker

### Core Philosophy
- Focus on basic barbell movements
- Linear progression is king for novices
- Simplicity over complexity
- 5 reps is the sweet spot for strength (singles too heavy for volume, 8+ too light for intensity)
- Whole body training > split routines for beginners

### The Big Five Exercises
1. **Squat** - Low bar position, hip drive emphasis
2. **Deadlift** - Conventional, limited to 1x5 due to fatigue
3. **Bench Press** - Full ROM, controlled descent
4. **Press** (Overhead) - Strict military press
5. **Power Clean** - Explosive power development

### Program Structure

#### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)
**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press/Press: 3x5 (alternate)
- Deadlift: 1x5

**Workout B:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Press/Bench Press: 3x5 (alternate)
- Deadlift: 1x5

Schedule: 3x/week (Mon/Wed/Fri or similar)

#### Phase 2 (Variable duration)
**Workout A:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Bench Press/Press: 3x5
- Deadlift: 1x5

**Workout B:**
- Squat: 3x5
- Press/Bench Press: 3x5
- Power Clean: 5x3

#### Phase 3 (Advanced novice)
**Week 1:**
- Monday: Squat, Bench, Deadlift
- Wednesday: Squat, Press, Power Clean
- Friday: Squat, Bench, Chin-ups

**Week 2:**
- Monday: Squat, Press, Deadlift
- Wednesday: Squat, Bench, Power Clean
- Friday: Squat, Press, Chin-ups

### Progression Guidelines

#### Weight Increases
- Squat: +10 lbs first 2-3 sessions, then +5 lbs
- Deadlift: +10-15 lbs first 2-3 sessions, then +5-10 lbs
- Bench/Press: +5-10 lbs initially, then +2.5-5 lbs
- Power Clean: +5 lbs per session

#### For Different Populations
- Males 18-35: Standard progression
- Females: 50% of male increments
- Older lifters (40+): Conservative progression, see 'Barbell Prescription'
- Teens: Can often handle standard or aggressive progression

### Warm-up Protocol
1. Empty bar x 5 x 2 sets
2. Add 25-45 lbs x 5
3. Add 25-45 lbs x 3
4. Add 25-45 lbs x 2
5. Working weight x 5 x 3

### Rest Periods
- 2-5 minutes between sets
- Should not be breathing heavily when starting next set
- When in doubt, rest longer

### Reset Protocol
If you fail to complete 3x5 for two consecutive workouts:
1. Reduce to 90% of current weight
2. Work back up with smaller increments
3. Consider moving to intermediate programming if multiple resets

### Client Adaptations

#### For Strength Goals
- Follow program exactly as written
- Focus on consistent weight increases
- Eat in caloric surplus
- Sleep 8+ hours

#### For General Fitness Clients
- Can start with goblet squats if mobility limited
- May use dumbbells for pressing initially
- Progress more conservatively
- Add conditioning on off days after Phase 1

#### For Athletes
- Power cleans introduced earlier
- May add sport-specific work on off days
- Consider 2x/week in-season

#### For Rehabilitation
- Work with clearance from medical professional
- Start with bodyweight or very light loads
- Focus on perfect form over progression
- May stay in Phase 1 longer

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Adding assistance exercises too early
- Not eating enough
- Progressing too aggressively
- Skipping warm-ups
- Not resting enough between sets
- Program hopping

### When to Move On
Graduate from Starting Strength when:
- Multiple resets have occurred
- Progress stalls despite proper recovery
- Typically 3-9 months for most trainees
- Consider Texas Method or 5/3/1 next
